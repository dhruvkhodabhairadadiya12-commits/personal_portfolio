# personal_portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website developed as part of a university coursework assignment.  
The website showcases my profile, technical skills, services, and selected projects using modern but simple web technologies.

The focus of this project is clean structure, readability, responsiveness, and basic interactivity rather than over-complex features.
